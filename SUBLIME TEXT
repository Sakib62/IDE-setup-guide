**INSTALLING AND SETTING UP SUBLIME TEXT AND MINGW COMPILER::

Go to - https://www.sublimetext.com/download and click on windows.
Then install Sublime Text. Since, it is a text editor you need to install a compiler for it to run your code.
You can download minGW compiler. After installing, you need to copy the path of bin folder to the system variable path.

Now your compiler is set up. 
But one problem! You can only output, can't take input. For input, we need to setup new Build System. 

**SETTING UP SUBLIME TEXT FOR TAKING INPUT::
You can do it in 3 ways. 

1. When you run the code(ctrl  +shift + B), a pop up window will apear which take input and show output.
    Open Sublime Text. Goto Tools -> Build System -> New Build System..
    Delete the deafult code and paste the following:
    
    {
        "cmd": ["g++.exe", "-std=c++14", "-o", "$file_base_name", "$file", "&&", "start", "cmd", "/c", "$file_base_name & echo. & echo. & pause"],
        "shell": true,
        "selector": "source.c++"
    }

    Click ctrl + shift + s to save the file. You can name it as you wish. But the extension should be sublime-build
    Such as: C++ Pop Up Window.sublime-build
    
    Then Goto Tools -> Build System -> C++ Pop Up Window. Now run the code and a pop up window will appear.

2. I call this a perfect build system for input-output in sublime text.
    
    Goto View -> Layout -> Columns:3
    Again goto View -> Groups -> Max Columns:2
    Now you can give input in the top right side, and bottom right side, you will get output.
    But first we need to create a new Build System.
    
    Open Sublime Text. Goto Tools -> Build System -> New Build System..
    Delete the deafult code and paste the following:
    
    {
        "cmd": ["g++.exe","-std=c++17", "${file}", "-o", "${file_base_name}.exe", "&&" , "${file_base_name}.exe<input.txt>output.txt"],
        "selector":"source.cpp",
        "shell":true,
        "working_dir":"$file_path"
    }
    
    Click ctrl + shift + s to save the file. You can name it as you wish. But the extension should be sublime-build
    Such as: C++ Perfect.sublime-build
    
    Then Goto Tools -> Build System -> C++ Perfect. 
    Click on the top right input section and create a new file(ctrl + N). Name it input.txt
    Click on bottom right output section and create a new file. Name it output.txt
    These two files should be in the same folder with your .cpp file. Meaning, the code you want to run, input.txt, output.txt should be in same folder.
    
    Now give your input first, and run your code.
    You should put your cursor in the programming file to run that file. If you put your cursor in input or output file and run, it will give errors.

3. Now back to the original. When you installed and setup Sublime and Compiler, we could only output by selecting C++ Single File run.
   Now we want to take input in the same panel rather than pop up window or sideview described above. For that We need install a package.
   
   Goto Tools -> Install Package Control. It will be installed.
   Now click Preferences -> Package Control. Type Install Package and click on it. Now type Terminus.
   
   If installation does not start, close and reopen sublime. Again search Terminus following above instructions. 
   You will see that installation ongiong in the below bar.
   
   Now, you can choose either of the following option.
   
   OPTION 1:: (LONG ONE)
   
   Goto Tools -> command Palette. Delete deafult text and type vpf. Click on View Package File. Type sublime-build c. 
   Click on C++/C++ Single File.sublime-build
   Copy the existing code.
   
   Now create New Build System. Delete default code and paste the code that you copied.
   You need to add two extra lines below '{' and before existing first line:: 
        "target": "terminus_exec",
        "cancel": "terminus_cancel_build", 
   
   Now save the file and name it C++ in Terminus.sublime-build
   Goto Tools -> Build System -> C++ in Terminus. Now run your code and it should work fine. Give input in the below terminus console and get ouput!!
   
   OPTIION 2:: (EASIER ONE)    
   
   Create a new build system. Delete the default code and paste the following:
   
   {
	    "target": "terminus_exec",
	    "cancel": "terminus_cancel_build",
	
	    "shell_cmd": "g++ \"${file}\" -o \"${file_path}/${file_base_name}\"",
	    "file_regex": "^(..[^:]*):([0-9]+):?([0-9]+)?:? (.*)$",
	    "working_dir": "${file_path}",
	    "selector": "source.c++",

	    "variants":
	  [
		  {
			  "name": "Run",
			  "shell_cmd": "g++ \"${file}\" -o \"${file_path}/${file_base_name}\" && \"${file_path}/${file_base_name}\""
		  }
	  ]
  }
  
    
   Now save the file and name it C++ in Terminus.sublime-build
   Goto Tools -> Build System -> C++ in Terminus. Now run your code and it should work fine. Give input in the below terminus console and get ouput!!

That's it guys. I hope your sublime text is set up now and you can take input-output and run your code smoothly. 
    
Finally, I have created a playlist merging all the necessary videos to set up SUblime Text
